# The Lost Duckling

### Our game
  #### This game is about a lost duckling that is stuck on the far end of an island trying to make it back to its mother. There are several obstacles in its way, including menacing crocodiles, snapping turtles, and the most dangerous of all, the hawk which stands between the duckling and the mother. Will the duckling make it back? Or will it be tonight's dinner? It's in your hands. 

### Why we wanted to make it
  #### We were all passionate about games, and always wanted to create a game that had a story and multiple elements. This game has elements of a side scroller, platformer, running gun and takes inspiration from some popular games while giving it a twist

### How we did it
  #### We used javascript and the p5 library and created several original textures and artwork to provide a unique look.
